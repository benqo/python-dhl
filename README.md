# Python DHL

This is a python package for using the DHL webservice. 
It allows developers to easily connect to DHL services and make requests. 
The package creates SOAP requests using the [suds-jurko](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/suds-jurko/0.6) package
to create shipments, schedule a pickup and possibly to delete a created shipment.
It also provides the ability to save the shipping labels to a file.

## Installation

Python DHL is available through pip. To easily install or upgrade it, do

    pip install --upgrade python-dhl

## Usage

To send a shipment you need to create:

1. The DHL service
2. The sender
3. The receiver
4. The packages
5. The shipment that connects the sender, receiver and the packages

And then use the DHL service to send the shipment.

### Create the DHL service

Initialize a new DHL service using

```python
service = DHLService('username', 'password', 'accountNumber')
``` 
You can also use the DHL test mode

```python
service.test_mode = True
``` 
     
### Create the sender

Sender can either be a ``DHLPerson`` or a ``DHLCompany``.

```python
sender = DHLCompany(
            company_name='GitHub',
            person_name='Git Hub',
            street_lines='275 Brannan Street',
            city='San Francisco',
            postal_code='94107',
            country_code='US',
            phone='11111111',
            email='git@github.com'
            )
``` 
    
    
### Create the receiver

Receiver can also be either a ``DHLPerson`` or a ``DHLCompany``.

```python
receiver = DHLPerson(
            person_name='Jon Doe',
            street_lines='276 Brannan Street',
            city='San Francisco',
            postal_code='94107',
            country_code='US',
            phone='11111111',
            email='jon@github.com'
            )
``` 
    
    
### Create the packages

The packages are ``DHLPackage`` objects and are supposed to be in a list.

```python
packages = [
    DHLPackage(
        weight=0.15,
        width=10,
        length=10,
        height=10,
        price=100,
        description='Good product'
    ),
    DHLPackage(
        weight=0.15,
        width=10,
        length=10,
        height=10,
        price=100,
        description='The best product'
    )
]
``` 
    
    
### Create the shipment

Shipment is a ``DHLShipment`` object and connects the sender, receiver and the packages.

```python
shipment = DHLShipment(sender, receiver, packages)
``` 

By default, the shipment date is set to current date and time. You can change it by setting the

```python
shipment.ship_datetime = datetime.now + timedelta(hours=1)
``` 

Note the date has to be in a future and it has to be valid (no weekends, holidays...)

#### Other options

Please check the ``DHLShipment`` class for the full list of possible options.
    
   
#### Request Rates for a shipment
It's possible to request service rates from DHL, call

```python
rate_response = service.rate_request(shipment)
```

Once the request finish and if is a successful request it will store the services with the rates for each service

```python
print rate_response.services

[{'next_business_day_ind': N,
  'delivery_time': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 30, 12, 0),
  'charges': [
        {'charge_type': MEDICAL EXPRESS, 'currency': EUR, 'charge_amount': 319.50},
        {'charge_type': FUEL SURCHARGE, 'currency': EUR, 'charge_amount': 30.35}
  ],
  'total_net': {'currency': EUR, 'amount': 349.85},
  'cutoff_time': datetime.datetime(2015, 10, 29, 18, 0),
  'type': C
}]
```

#### Request a pickup
If you wish to request a courier pickup, set the variable and provide the latest pickup time.
    
```python
shipment.request_courier = True
shipment.pickup_time = datetime.now + timedelta(hours=2)
``` 

By default the pickup time is set to 1 hour from the creation of the shipment.
    

### Send the shipment

You are now ready to send the shipment. Simply call

```python
response = service.send(shipment)
``` 
    
Once the service is done, it stores the tracking number, identification number and the label in the ``DHLShipmentResponse``.
It also saves the dispatch identification number in case a pickup was requested as well.

You can save the label to a file (by default to folder ``labels/``, you can change this by changing ``shipment.label_path``)

```python
shipment.save_label_to_file(response.label_bytes)
```
